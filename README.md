This tutorial will give a prespective on data prepration for a simple morphological segmentation task.

There are two main goals in this excercise:
- Prepare and explore data
- Get familiar with unix commands

In a larger project, you will likely need to write a proper script to deal with the data and prepare it. But sometimes you want to explore the data and get quick counts for different scenarios before fully comitting to using the data. This is what we are doing in this excercise.
